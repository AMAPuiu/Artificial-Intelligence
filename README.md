## A* Algorithm

#### 8-puzzle
The puzzle consists of N tiles and one empty space where the tiles can be moved. Given a Start and Goal configuration, the script solves the puzzle by moving the tiles one by one in the empty space using th A* algorithm.

#### Blocks
Given N stacks and a Start and Goal configuration, the script reaches the goal by moving only the top element of each stack according to A*. 

#### Cannibals and Missionaries
Given N cannibals, N missionaries and a boat with the capacity of M, the script moves the people from one site of the river to the other by using the A* algorithm.

#### Tiles
Given a vertical grid with square, colourful tiles, the script empties the grid by removing areas of tiles of the same colour. When removing a tile, the tiles above it fall in its place. When a column is empty, the other columns on its right move to the left by one tile. It implements the A* algorithm.
